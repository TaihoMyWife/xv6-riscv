## Problem 1
### 1, Ans: $\Theta$
### Proof:
We can prove the sqrt{3}^{logn} is \theta(n) that:
$$
assume the \ f(n) = \sqrt{3}^{logn}\\
Then,we can get log f(n) = log(\sqrt{3}^{logn})\\
= (log(3)/2) * logn\\
so log f(n) = \Theta(logn)
$$
finally $f(n)=\Theta (n)$   

### 2, Ans: $o$
### Proof:
assume logn=t. then we will get

$logt=o(\sqrt{t})$
 I.e. $loglogn=o(\sqrt{logn})$

### 3, Ans: $\Theta$

### Proof:

e has a define as below :
$lim_{n\to +\infin} n!=\frac{n^n}{e^n}$, 

Then apply the log to both side, it turns to:
$log(n!)=nlog(n/e)=\Theta(nlogn)$

### 4, Ans: $o$
### Proof:
follow the rule that $lim_{n\to+\infin}$, then we will have $3^n/2^n=(1.5)^n>>1$
So we can say that the it is true that
$$
2^n=o(3^n)
$$
## Prob2
### (1)
$$
T(n) = T(n/2) + n log n
$$
due to master theorem:
- $a = 1$ , $b = 2$
- $f(n) = n log n$
- $n^{log_b a} = n^0 = 1$
- $f(n) = \Theta(n log n)$
Therefore, due to the master theorem(3), there must exists a c<1 so that $nlog(n/2)/2\le cnlogn$: we can finaly get
$T(n) = \Theta(n log n)$ 
### (2)
$$
T(n) = 2T(n/4) + \sqrt{n}
$$
due to the master theorem:
- $a = 2, b = 4, and\ f(n) = \sqrt{n}$
- $n^{log_b a} = n^{1/2}$
- $f(n) = \Theta(\sqrt{n})$
Therefore, by master theorem(2), $T(n) = \Theta(\sqrt{n} log n)$ 

### (3)

$$
T(n) = 4T(n/4) + n^{1/2}
$$
due the master theorem:
- $a = 4$, $b = 4$, and $f(n) = n^{1/2}$
- $n^{log_b a} = n$
- $f(n) = \Theta(n^{1/2})$
Therefore, by master theorem(1), $T(n) = \Theta(n)$   

## Prob3

(1)

We can just use a binary search method to locate the bad candy.
- 1.divide candies into left and right part equally, then pick lighter part has the bad candy, 
- 2.then we continually call binary search on that lighter part 
- 3 finally we find the bad candy from last 2 candies. 
We don’t need to search on the greater part.
Then cost is same as binary search, which is $(log_2n)$

### (2)
still use binary search. 
- 1 Each time, we separate array into 3 subarray equally.
- 2 Then test if first part is lighter than second, if is lighter, then bad candy is in second and same works for contrast.
- 3 If they are equal, then bad candy is in third part.
continually run such search on the lighter part until last 3 candies.
The cost is $log_3n$ since we only need 1 dollar to shrink  search range from n to n/3. 

### (3)
still use binary search. 
- 1 Each time, we separate array into 3 subarray equally.
- 2 If there are 2 parts are equal, and the third part is smaller than them, then there are bad candy in third part,  
- 3 If there 2 parts are equal, and the third part is bigger than them, then we so we can search equal part.
- To decide the relationship, we do 3 testing 
The cost is $O(logn)$ due to the above. 

### (4)

Each time, we separate our input into k+1 subarray equally, 1,2,3… ${k+1}$

- because there are at most k candies, so there must have one with max weight called k. 
- then all other parts that are qual to k have no bad candies
- If a part is lighter than k, run search on it.

To decide the relationship, we have to do at most k+k-1…+1 testing $(k+1)^2$ dollars.
The cost will be $O(log_kn*(k+1)^2*k)=O(logn)$.

### (2)-1

for bubble sort: Bubble sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares adjacent items, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Then there will be pair of elements (A[i], A[j]) (i < j and A[i] > A[j]) each pair should be the target of bubble sort’s swap. 

The total number of pairs in an array is a measure of its "unsortedness." 
Bubble sort performs a swap only if there is an pair need to swap in the array. 
Therefore, each swap performed by bubble sort reduces the total number of pairs by 1. 

so we cannot reduce the number of pairs by more in a single swap
bubble sort achieves the optimal number of swaps when considering adjacent swaps only.

### (2)-2

Recap: According to (2)-1, bubble sort’s swap times is optimal and each swap in bubble sort reduce pair by 1.
I will use divide-and-conquer method, it is a variant of mergesort.
In mergesort, run function on 2 subarrays and then merge them to get a ordered array.
This algorithm modifies the original merge( ) into
```jsx
long long merge_sort(vector<int>& a, int left, int right) {
    if (left == right) {
        return 0;
    }

    int mid = (left + right) / 2;
    //seprate the array in half
    long long ans = merge_sort(a, left, mid) + merge_sort(a, mid+1, right);
    //get the ans from former funtion
    vector<int> tmp(right-left+1);
    int i = left, j = mid+1, k = 0;
    while (i <= mid && j <= right) {
        if (a[i] <= a[j]) {
            tmp[k++] = a[i++];
        } else {
            tmp[k++] = a[j++];
            ans += mid - i + 1;
        }
    }
    //do swap
    while (i <= mid) {
        tmp[k++] = a[i++];
    }
    while (j <= right) {
        tmp[k++] = a[j++];
    }

    for (int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
        a[i] = tmp[i-left];
    }

    return ans;
}
```
Both sub arrays(A,B) should be sorted array, we can easily merge them together
then we can easily maintain just 1 pointer for each subarray 
then we compare the values that pointers point to. 
when merging we can get an increasing order array with pointer i,j 
- if A[i]<B[j] ,elements are in the correct order
- if A[i]>B[i] ,means that there is a pair. 
we can count number of pairs, the output is the minist number of swaps.
The time complexity is same with merge sort, which is $O(nlogn)$.

### (2)-3

same to the above part, mean cost should be count the number of pairs. 

Each swap in bubble sort reduce a pair. 
SO we know the number of pairs in an array(optimal swap times.)
So the algorithm output is the number of pairs. 

## Prob5

to get the `unique-in-range`  array, we should find  a unique number in range of whole array.
if we find an array does have a overall unique number, judge if it is a unique-in-range, then we need to inspect its subarray about which do not have the overall unique number.
so we can give out a divide-and-conquer algorithm that uses the `unique number` in certain range as a pivot to divide the range into 2 smaller range.
pseudocode as below:

```
unique_in_range(array, left, right):
    if(left == right)
        return True
    pivot = find_unique_range(array, left, right)
    if(pivot == -1)
        return False
    return unique_in_range(array, left, pivot - 1) + unique_in_range(array, pivot + 1, right)

find_unique_range(array, left, right):
    counter = {}
    // Iterate through the specified range and update the counter
    for(int i =left;i<right;i++){
        if(array[i] in counter)
            counter[array[i]] += 1
        else
            counter[array[i]] = 1
    }
    // Find the first unique number
    unique = none
    go through the counter:
        if(count == 1)
            unique = number
            break

    If unique is not null
       return array.index(unique)
	else return -1

```

The time of finding unique should be O(n),  if we assume that unique element appear randomly, it is same as quicksort, so it’s $O(quicksort)=O(nlogn)$ whp.
